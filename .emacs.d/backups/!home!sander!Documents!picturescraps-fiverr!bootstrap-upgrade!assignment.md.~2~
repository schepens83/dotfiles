# Upgrade Rails app from Bootstrap 3 to 5

- I have a rails 6.0 and ruby 2.5 app that can be seen [here](www.picture-scraps.com). 
- It currently uses bootstrap 3 via the less-rails-bootstrap gem. This should be replaced to gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.6'. 
- As-is views should be updated so they work with bootstrap 5 version.
- One new layout should be added that uses 'p-3 bg-white' class. See example [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/sidebars/)
